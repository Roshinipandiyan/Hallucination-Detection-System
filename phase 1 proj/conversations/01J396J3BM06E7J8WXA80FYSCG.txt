Text: you for calling at PSG. My name is Tina Who do I have the pleasure of speaking with?
Summary A: The customer contacted the agent to seek assistance with activating a new iPad, replacing an existing iPad on the account, and adding a new iPhone to the plan. The agent helped the customer activate the new iPad, change the plan to add a new iPhone for the customer's mother, and suggested different plan options based on the customer's requirements. They discussed the transfer of billing responsibility for the customer's mother's line onto the customer's account. The customer's new iPad was successfully activated, the plan change for the new iPhone addition was initiated, and the process of transferring the customer's mother's line onto the customer's account was explained. The customer was informed about the waiting period for upgrades after the transfer and provided with information on plan changes and associated costs. Broadband facts were discussed in the conversation.
