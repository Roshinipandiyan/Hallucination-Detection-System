Summary A: Customer inquired about purchasing two Galaxy watches and connecting them to existing devices without having separate phone numbers. The agent explained that in order to purchase the watches in installments, a new line with a separate phone number would be required. However, the customer can sync the watches to their phone to receive calls and messages seamlessly. The customer was satisfied with the explanation and agreed to proceed with adding a new line for the watches. The agent transferred the customer to the billing department for further assistance with the order.
