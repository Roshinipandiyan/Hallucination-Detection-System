Summary A: The customer called to inquire about setting up Internet services but encountered an issue related to a direct account that needed to be settled. The agent attempted to set up Internet service but discovered that a direct account was causing a problem. The agent explained that a $100 advance payment was required based on a credit check. The customer decided not to proceed due to financial constraints. The issue regarding the direct account was identified but not fully resolved. No order was placed under the customer's name due to the credit check requirement. The customer expressed inability to make the payment at that time.
