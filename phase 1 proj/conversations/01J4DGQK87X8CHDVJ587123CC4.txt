Summary A: Customer inquiring about purchasing a new device but had a remaining balance from an old wireless account. Agent suggested two options: pay off the remaining balance to open a new account or add a new line to an existing account for immediate purchase of the new device. Customer opted to pay off the remaining balance and proceeded with the transaction. The order was successfully completed, and the new device was scheduled to be delivered on August 6th, with the payment for sale taxes being the only requirement to proceed.
