Summary A: Customer contacted regarding the service not being restored despite the payment scheduled and issues with old account still being active. Agent suggested making a payment for the past due balance to restore the service and proposed moving the service from the old address to the new one to address the issue with the active old account. The agent set up an appointment for the service to be activated on the seventeenth, disconnected the old service, and provided compensation for the inconvenience caused. The customer agreed to the proposed actions, and the issues were resolved satisfactorily. Broadband facts were discussed in the conversation.
