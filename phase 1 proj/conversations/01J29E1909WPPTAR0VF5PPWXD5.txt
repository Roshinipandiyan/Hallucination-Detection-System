Text: Thank you for contacting the PSG Sales Department. This is Jose (****) speaking. May I ask who I'm speaking with and how I can assist you today?
Summary A: Customer contacted PSG sales department to purchase 2 iPhone 15 Pro Max with new numbers and a specific plan. Agent assisted the customer in selecting the Unlimited Stark plan for both phones, enrolled them in autopay, and provided details about additional features available. The customer declined insurance and device upgrade options. The customer agreed to the selected plan and payment method, but encountered issues with card payment authorization. After multiple attempts, the customer provided an alternative card for successful payment processing. The order was confirmed for delivery to the customer's preferred billing address in Arizona. Broadband facts were discussed in the conversation.
