Summary A: The customer contacted the agent to address charges on their bill for a period when they did not have service due to cancellation. The agent reviewed the billing period and prorated charges, applied a credit adjustment for damaged equipment, and confirmed the return of equipment. The customer's bill was adjusted to reflect only the valid charges, and the issue with the billing discrepancy was resolved.
