Summary A: The customer contacted the agent to inquire about international data plan options while traveling to Canada and to address unexpected international data charges on their bill. The agent identified that the customer's current plan did not cover Canada and offered to switch them to the Unlimited Starter plan, which includes Mexico and Canada coverage. The agent also explained a more cost-effective billing option for the customer. The agent successfully resolved the issue by changing the customer's plan to the Unlimited Starter plan to cover their usage in Canada and provided information about reducing billing costs moving forward. The customer was satisfied with the resolution and agreed to the plan change.
