Text: Advanced tech support. My name is Richard, how can I help you.
Summary A: The customer contacted advanced tech support because the daughter's phone line was showing as unavailable and not connecting calls. The agent recommended checking the SIM card, verifying the phone's settings, setting up the eSIM, and ensuring the device was connected to the internet for activation. After following the agent's instructions, the issue with the daughter's phone line was resolved, and the activation process was successful. The agent identified that the phone's eSIM was associated with a physical SIM card, which caused the issue, and rectified it.
