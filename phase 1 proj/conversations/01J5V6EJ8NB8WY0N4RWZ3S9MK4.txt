Summary A: Customer inquiring about fees for the new phone on the bill. The agent checked the customer's account and reassured the customer that the fees in the email were not alarming and that the actual bill cycle would provide more clarity. The customer was informed about the discounts not reflected in the email, and the agent offered to send broadband facts via email. The customer was satisfied with the explanation and indicated they had to leave. Broadband facts were discussed in the conversation.
