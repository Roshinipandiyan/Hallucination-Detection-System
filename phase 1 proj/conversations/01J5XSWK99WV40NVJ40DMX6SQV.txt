Text: Good afternoon, my name is Chris Lenny Who do I have the pleasure of speaking with today?
Summary A: The customer received a bill from a telecommunications company for services they do not use and are unsure why. The agent suggested the customer to block the payment through their bank since the account does not have the customer's name and they have no access to it. The agent also recommended contacting the company to inquire about the bill. The customer was advised to block the payment through their bank as the account did not belong to them, and they were unable to access it to cancel the autopay. Further steps involved contacting the company to clarify the situation. .
