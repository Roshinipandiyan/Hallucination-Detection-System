Text: Hi! This is Gex from PSG Mobility Sales Team. I'm a live agent ready to assist. May I have your name please?
Summary A: Customer inquired about setting up PSG Fiber internet service and inquired about the possibility of a seasonal/vacation hold for both internet and cable service. The agent assisted the customer in selecting an internet plan, clarified the month-to-month payment option with no contract, guided through the application process, and provided information about suspending the internet service during vacation. The customer successfully placed an order for PSG Fiber internet service, received the earliest installation date, and was informed about the process of suspending the service during vacation. The agent directed the customer to contact the cable team for information regarding cable services and resolved the customer's inquiries satisfactorily. Broadband facts were discussed in the conversation.

Summary A: 
Response: 
Answer: 

Speaker: SENDER_AGENT
Text: I understand that you really want to know the exact taxes and fees. Let me reiterate that it depends on the state regulations that apply. So to say, your taxes and fees at your state and city will be different from such of Texas.
 
 Moreover, this typically around $4-$6/mo. One way for us to find out the taxes and fees that I can share is checking your bill from your service provider and look for the monthly taxes and fees. Thus, the same amounts may apply.
