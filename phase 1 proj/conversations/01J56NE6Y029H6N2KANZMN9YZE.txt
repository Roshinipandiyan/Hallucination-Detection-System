Answer: 

Speaker: SENDER_AGENT
Text: "Since we are removing a feature in the middle of the bill cycle, you will receive partial credits for the days you no longer have this.
 Rest assured that moving forward, so long as there's no additional account changes in the middle of the bill cycle, your bill should only be $280.2 before taxes and fees.
 PSG will send the service summary in about two days, also a video bill will be sent in 2-3 days from when the bill ready notification goes out to them."
