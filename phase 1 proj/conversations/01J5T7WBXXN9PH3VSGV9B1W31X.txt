Summary A: Customer called to inquire about how to reduce their monthly bill, which has been consistently high. The agent suggested lowering the bill significantly by enrolling in auto pay and paperless billing to get discounts, cancelling a line on the account, switching to a lower plan for additional savings, and paying off the remaining device installment. The customer agreed to enroll in auto pay and paperless billing, cancel a line, switch to a lower plan, and pay off the device installment to lower the bill by approximately $100 monthly.
