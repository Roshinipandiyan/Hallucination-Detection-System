Summary A: Customer contacted regarding an unexpected increase in their bill after receiving an email about plan changes. The agent explained that the increase in the bill was due to being on a grandfather plan with additional data allowances, and the amount mentioned in the email was an estimation, not the actual bill. The agent offered options for autopay discounts and clarified the differences between debit and credit card discounts. The customer expressed concern over security and requested a manager callback for further assistance.
