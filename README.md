# Hallucination-Detection-System
This project implements a hallucination detection system for conversation data, designed to identify whether a conversation contains hallucinations (misleading or incorrect information). The system allows users to upload a CSV file containing conversation details and then provides an interface to explore the conversations and their summaries.
